# Pentesting - searching for information and data

A penetration test, colloquially known as a pen test or ethical hacking, is an authorized simulated cyber-attack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system. The test is performed to identify weaknesses (also referred to as vulnerabilities), including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the systemâ€™s features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.
